    "The MNIST dataset is a very popular dataset of handwritten numbers that are often used to train various image processing systems. This dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The files containing the images can be located and downloaded from the [MNIST website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) in gzip form. However, because the images are not in any standard image rendering format, we must write our own program to be able to read the images and save them in the .png format. "

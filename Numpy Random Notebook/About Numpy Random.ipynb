    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook I will be discussing the ins and outs of the numpy.random package. Before I begin talking about the different kinds of random numbers that numpy can generate, I think it is important to fitrst have a quick run-through about what numpy actually is.\n",
    "Numpy is one of the most, if not the most powerful packages in python used for scientific or data analytical purposes. Numpy can contain a powerful N-dimensional array object, broadcasting functions, integration of C/C++ and Fortran code and useful linear algebra,  and Fourier transform. However the focus of this notebook will be numpy's random number capabilities.\n",

This is done simply by typing \"import numpy as np\". np is just a namespace, meaning that we will be referring to numpy by using \"np\" from here on out in the program. We will also be needing to import a package that will allow us to plot diagrams later on. "

You can add as many parameters as you would like, for example if you try adding a \"2,\" parameter in front of the other two parameters, you will then be returned 2 arrays, of 3 rows by 4 columns. \n",

However, in real life scenarios, the \"normal distribution\" might be a better and more realistic fit. In the normal distribution, some values are much more likely to be returned than others. For example, if you wanted to pick a random man out of a million men and calculate his height, you are more likely to return a value of between 5ft8 and 6ft3(depending on geographical location). "

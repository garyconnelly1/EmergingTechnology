# Emerging Technology Research Summary

In this document, I will discuss how I researched each of the topics discussed in the four notebooks and one script file in this repository. This project was completed as part of the Emerging Technology continuous-assesment assignment for 4th year.

## About Numpy Random:
The first notebook I wrote for this module was about pythons numpy random package. This notebook was also my very first experience learning about and writing python code. Because it was my first time to use python, I really did't have any idea what numpy was or what it did. 

My first thought was to go straight to the python docs and look for information about numpy, but I thought it would be a better idea to read the wikipedia page for numpy because I knew that it would be written in such a way that even people who know nothing about python would be able to understand it.

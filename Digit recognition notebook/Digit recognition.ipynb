Data comes in through the input layer, then an activation fucnction is executed on the data in the the hidden layer/s, and finally the data is is then output. The particular kind of neural network we will be working with is called a \"fully connected\", or \"dense\" network, because each node of each layer is connected to every node in the next layer. This will make more sense when I start to go through the program."
